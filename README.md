# Hello-World
My first repo upon joining GitHub

<p>Now I will begin to make changes using Branches (similar to Sandbox in SF).</p>
<p>Once a change is saved, it's a committ.</p> 
<p>Each committ has a committ message.  This should explain why you made that change so others can follow your train of thought.</p>
